It was a fantastic start for me to start with the theme Loveit.

Prior to when I wanted to apply some personalization. It was very painful.

I'm not a graphic designer, and I'm not familiar with javascript's development. CSS is difficult for me to use. I'm unable to adhere to the es6 standard.

The site loads slow in China. As I dug deeper, I discovered it depends on numerous CDN third-party dependencies as well as a polyfill.io dependency. Connection to polyfill.io usually takes about one or two seconds from China. The design is good. But doesn't quite meets my requirement. 

I am familiar with jquery and the grid system.

So, using what I am most familiar with, bootstrap and jquery, I rebuilt the theme.

Everything was relocated to static files when I disabled the third party CDN.

I also included a contact form for anyone who wishes to get in touch after reading my post.

I refer to it as fuckit because when I tried to personalize Loveit, that's what came to mind. Fuck it, I'll write one myself.
